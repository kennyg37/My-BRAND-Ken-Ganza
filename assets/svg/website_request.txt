okay so i want a website that has a gpt api that has a chatbot that can give out answers. The landing page should have tha main section which is dynamic and kinda looks futuristic with a nav bar that takes the background of the background picture of that futuristic question. The nav should also have the words KEMO as the logo. Next, the landing page should have about with 3 divs that are aligned vertically but one starts on the left the next starts from the center and the last one starts from the left too. The about divs should have a picture and a description you can also add other elements you want. Below that you can add a pricing section that has all the prices then below the testimonials. The nav bar should have a home, about, pricing, blog and signup section. The signup section should have a background and a border radius. upon signup that is where we have other pages one being Dashboard, app and logout in app that is where the chatbot and everything the website does will be. Build this website in html5, css and vanilla js. after that i'll handle the backend with nodejs so you will have to leave space for node js requests. go crazy put some crazy features too. hope you deliver
